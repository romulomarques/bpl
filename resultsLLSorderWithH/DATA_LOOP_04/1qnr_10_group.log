We use a different pair of symbles to represent the bits values which are associated with the HA and H of the discretized distance, and another one to represent the bits of other hydrogens.
For the HA and H from the discretized distance:
	"+" means 0
	"-" means 1
For any other hydrogens:
	">" means 0
	"<" means 1
